# ChicagoData
Extracted valuable insights from three extensive database samples by importing
data from the Chicago Data Portal, including crime, census, and public school
data, into an IBM Db2 database instance. These databases were effectively
managed and analyzed within a Python-based Jupyter Notebook, employing
SQL queries to drive meaningful analysis and results.
